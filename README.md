# Anxiety-among-higher-education-students
1. Introduction:

“Anxiety is a significant issue in higher education, affecting a large percentage of students. In India, 56.8% of students experience some form of anxiety disorder, including panic disorders, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and school avoidance. Anxiety in higher education is multifaceted, driven by academic pressures, social comparison, instructor behaviors, and a lack of support systems.”

2. Research Hypothesis:

“Our research aimed to explore how anxiety manifests in students and what factors contribute to it in the academic environment. We hypothesized that the academic and social pressures, combined with the lack of adequate mental health solutions, exacerbate anxiety among students in higher education.”

3. Methodology:

“We employed both primary and secondary research methods. The primary data was collected through interviews with students, professors, and counselors, along with a survey of 75 students. The survey assessed the prevalence of anxiety using the GAD-7 scale and explored coping mechanisms. Secondary data included literature reviews of existing research on anxiety in students.

We used two approaches:

Requirement Engineering to identify specific concerns of students, professors, and counselors.
Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to understand stakeholder perspectives and promote empathy and inclusivity.”
4. Findings:
“Our research revealed several factors contributing to anxiety:

Academic pressures, such as deadlines and exams.
Social comparison and public display of grades.
Decreased interaction between students and professors.
Students’ hesitation to seek help due to fear and lack of awareness.
Counselors identified overthinking about future events and a lack of social support as key anxiety drivers. Professors noted that large class sizes make it harder to recognize struggling students, which hinders academic performance.”

5. Proposed Solutions:
“To address these issues, we propose a digital intervention, combining online and offline solutions:

A mobile app that provides students with access to stress-relief activities such as yoga, meditation, and a buddy system.
Integration with the ‘YourDOST’ platform for easy access to counselors.
Professors and students can engage in structured events to promote better communication.
This platform is designed to create a safe environment for students, improve interaction with peers and professors, and provide preventive as well as curative solutions to manage anxiety.”

6. Conclusion:
“Our study highlights the need for comprehensive solutions that address the social, academic, and mental health dimensions of student anxiety. By combining digital and physical interventions, we can create a more supportive ecosystem for higher education students. Moving forward, expanding these solutions to more institutions and workplaces could provide broader relief for those experiencing anxiety.”
